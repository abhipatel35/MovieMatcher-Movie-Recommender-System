# MovieMatcher: Movie Recommender System using MovieLens Dataset

## Overview

**MovieMatcher** is a movie recommendation system developed using the **MovieLens dataset**, which contains over 32 million user ratings. This project focuses on building a scalable and accurate recommendation pipeline by leveraging advanced techniques such as Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Models. The goal is to address common challenges like data sparsity, cold start problems, and over-specialization.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented a scalable recommendation pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Developed models using techniques such as **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and hybrid approaches to enhance recommendation diversity and accuracy.
- Achieved a **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** of **0.9478** and a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of **0.7366**, ensuring high prediction accuracy.
- Ensured 100% user-item coverage and maintained a recommendation diversity of **0.58**, preventing over-specialization.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Surprise Library**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
